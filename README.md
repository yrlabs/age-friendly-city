# age-friendly-city
visualised journalism
For my MA Arts and Lifestyle Journalism graduation project, I created a package product consisting of two journlaistic articles about the importance of play, for both children and the elderly, and how to make cities more age/play-freindly.
This webpapp, website, page (however you define) it, is a visualisation of the core ideas discussed in these two articles. I built the models in Blender, made separte webpages by Unity and Needle Engine and published them to glitch.com, which are linked to the different buttons in my main scene built with three.js, html and css.
